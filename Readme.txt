Differences to the Project's rules:
    The only difference to this language syntax is that if-statements end with "ENDIF" macro instead of "END" that was instructed by the project's pdf.
    Every other rule is followed as given.


Notes:
    - Player 1 is always playing first.
    - The abilities the follow a loop cannot stack on each other ,the ability in the last for loop of the last round played overwrites the previous.
    - When a Pokemon has an active repetitive ability (for loop/ after statement) he casts also his round's ability. 
    - When a Pokemon is in its Pokeball he cannot cast for loops, until it gets out of it.
    - The Pokemon that is in its Pokeball cannot deal damage nor dealt damage.
    - A pokemon can only use healing abilities while the opponent Pokemon is in its Pokeball. If he uses soimething else he deals no damage and the Duel continues.
    - If a Pokemon is in its Pokeball and the opponent Pokemon uses a healing ability, the Pokemon in the Pokeball is not healed.
    - If a Pokemon puts himself in Pokeball, only the opponent can get him out, as when it's in Pokeball it cannot cast any abilities even for loops and after statements.
